# Courter
This project is a client-server exercise application modeling a tennis court booking service.
Our main goals with this application are to learn FastAPI and SQLAlchemy and to practice designing
and implementing a modern GUI using WPF, respectively. It is not meant to be fully-fledged software.
Courter will support the management of tennis court bookings of registered users at on-site clients and 
guest bookings handled by employees at a counter, for example.
