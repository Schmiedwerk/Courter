# Courter
With Courter, we model a tennis court booking service comprising a FastAPI-based server providing a RESTful API and a GUI client created with WPF. It is an exercise project with the goals of learning FastAPI and SQLAlchemy on the server side and practicing implementing modern GUIs on the client side.
We plan to support the management of tennis court bookings of registered users at on-site clients and 
guest bookings handled by employees at a counter.
